Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism\r\n\r\nThe instructions to download, install and start using the software are in [Github](http://www.github.com/robocomp/robocomp).\r\n\r\nLink to Google Summer of Code 2015 [GSOC 2015](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Frobocomp.github.io%2Frobocomp%2Fgsoc15-robocomp-ideas.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFS_V_0ma2tEd-4r2Ot7rzkI6rMUg)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@pbustos @ljmanso @marcoag \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
